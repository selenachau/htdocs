Oaks discusses the use of psychiatric drugs within the psychiatric system, prisons, and society at large. Oaks and James discuss their personal experience within the psychiatric system and their activism to free those wrongfully imprisoned. Break the Chains Conference planners stated the following vision: ""We are organizing this conference to educate people about the bleak reality of the prison crisis, to mobilize people from the anti-repression, prisoner-support and anti-capitalist movements, to humbly host like-minded activists from other regions in what we hope is to be an extremely powerful and productive convergence, to learn from survivors of the prison system and gain from them invaluable lessons about the nature of the beast we are up against, and to begin the difficult task of developing a cohesive, organized, diverse, and effective movement against state repression and the politics of mass imprisonment. As the ruling elite intensifies its repression more & more broadly, such a movement becomes necessary now more than ever before.""",,"David Oaks, David James",KBOO,Saleable,"This audio is property of The KBOO Foundation and may include additional rights holders.
